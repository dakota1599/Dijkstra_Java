Running this program on Windows
--------------------------------------
If you do not have it already, you need to download and install the Java Development Kit.  You can download it
for your machine here: https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/

Once you have the JDK installed, navigate into the Dijkstra directory through your command console.

The driver file for this program is Dijkstra.java.  You will need to compile the program using javac.  See below.

    javac Dijkstra.java

Once the program is compiled, you can run it with java.  See below.

    java Dijkstra.java

Once you have the program running through you command console, you can use it as expected.  It runs as requested
in the Assignment 5 instructions.
